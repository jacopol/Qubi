Extensions Input:

- allow gates xor, ite
- allow non-prefix qcir
- allow free variables

Preprocessing:
- early quantification (non-prenex)
- transform back to prenex
- remove (or skip) unused gates

Solving:
- use pairwise disjunction / conjunction
- use parallel disjunction/conjunctions

Improvements:
- option for setting tablesize, workers
- print peak BDD

- make parsing less fragile for whitespace
- make parsing survive and/or as gate names

- print gates and/or example with names/indices
- refactor: Reading and Writing in another class (try decorator pattern?)
- refactor: Solver could be an abstract class / interface
- refactor: generalize to other BDD packages

Correctness:
- repair or refute sat7/sat8 (-e vs -e -r)
