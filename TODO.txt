- allow non-prefix qcir
- allow gates xor, ite

- preprocessing:
  . early quantification (non-prenex)
  . transform back to prenex
  . combine blocks
  . flatten blocks

- variable reordering
- use pairwise disjunction / conjunction
- use (parallel) sylvan disjunction/conjunctions

- option for setting tablesize, workers
- print peak BDD

- make parsing less fragile for whitespace
- make parsing survive and/or as gate names
- test with no variables, only empty and/or gate

- print BDD with indices as names + option
- option to print BDD to file

- refactor: Reading and Writing in another class (design pattern?)
- refactor: Solver could be a separate class?
